# **SortPedia**

A visual, interactive encyclopedia of sorting algorithms — from the classics to the truly cursed.
Watch algorithms run step-by-step, compare behaviors, and explore how each one works under the hood.

## 🚀 Features

- Visual demonstrations of **many sorting algorithms**
- Includes both **efficient** and **inefficient / novelty** sorts
- Step-by-step controls: play, pause, step, speed adjustment
- Real-time metrics: comparisons, swaps, recursion depth
- Clean, educational explanations for each algorithm
- Built for smooth and accurate animations

## 🎯 Goals

- Make sorting algorithms easy to **see**, not just read about
- Provide a fun and intuitive way to compare algorithms
- Support a wide range of sorts, from Merge Sort to Bogo-Bogosort

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **SvelteKit**
- Web Workers for non-blocking algorithm execution

## 📦 Status

Early development — core structure and algorithm pipeline in progress.
